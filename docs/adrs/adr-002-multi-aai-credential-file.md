# Multi-Entry AAI Credential File vs Static Single-AAI Config

## Context and Problem Statement

Rucio already supports multiple AAI/IdP configurations: `idpsecrets.json` is keyed by IdP nickname, and users can select an issuer explicitly (e.g. via `--oidc-issuer`). Separately, Rucio RSEs can carry arbitrary key/value attributes, and OIDC-related RSE attributes already exist (`oidc_support`, `oidc_base_path`).

What is missing is a standard **RSE → AAI/IdP binding**: a first-class attribute that tells Rucio "this RSE authenticates against issuer X," and a mechanism that uses that binding to automatically resolve the correct entry in the credential file. Today the relationship between an RSE and the issuer/credentials used for token acquisition is not represented as a configuration concept at all — it would have to be inferred or hardcoded per component.

This gap becomes a hard blocker once a component must deal with more than one AAI at once — e.g. DLM needs source and destination tokens from different AAIs, and different RSEs may each sit behind a different issuer. The decision below is about introducing that RSE-to-AAI binding abstraction, and choosing the mechanism (a keyed credential file) that resolves it — not about adding multi-issuer support to Rucio, which already exists.

**Binding cardinality is explicitly one-to-one: each RSE binds to exactly one issuer.** DLM's need to hold tokens from multiple AAIs simultaneously is satisfied because *different RSEs* can each bind to a *different* issuer, not because a single RSE can bind to more than one. No RSE in the current deployment is known to require more than one issuer, and this ADR does not attempt to represent that case. If a single-RSE, multi-issuer requirement emerges later, it is out of scope here and needs its own follow-up decision (see Open Points).

**NOTE:** Transfers are executed by background daemons (conveyor) rather than in the context of an interactive user session, so the tokens involved are understood to be service-level (client credentials) rather than delegated user identity. If that holds, the binding only ever needs to resolve to one fixed service credential per RSE, with no per-user routing to design for — worth confirming with the Rucio team rather than assuming.

If this assumption is ever revisited in favor of user-delegated token exchange, `issuer_binding` resolving one static credential per RSE is not sufficient on its own: token exchange across two RSEs bound to *different* issuers additionally requires those issuers to trust each other (federation, or a mediating token service) — this ADR's file-and-attribute mechanism only solves *which* credential/issuer an RSE maps to, not whether two issuers can vouch for each other's tokens. That trust question sits outside this ADR's scope and would need its own decision if pursued. See Design-003's open questions for how this surfaced in practice.

This is a credential/config lifecycle concern, distinct from and sitting below the Authorization Service decision (see adr-authorization-service.md).

## Decision Drivers

* Support components acting as multi-AAI clients (e.g. DLM) without one-off config per component — achieved via per-RSE binding, not per-RSE multi-binding.
* Support secret rotation and revocation without redeploying components.
* Let RSE/AAI bindings be discoverable rather than assumed or hardcoded.
* Keep the operational and development footprint small — extend the existing config-loading pattern rather than building new infrastructure, and avoid introducing a secrets-manager dependency this decision does not require.
* Keep the binding representation as simple as Rucio's existing flat RSE-attribute model allows, rather than pre-building support for a cardinality no current RSE needs.

## Considered Options

1. Static single-AAI JSON config per component (current state) — no RSE-level binding at all.
2. Multi-entry AAI credential file, same structure as today's `idp-secrets.json` (including `client_id`, `client_secret`, `SCIM` credentials inline), keyed by binding name; a new RSE attribute holds the binding key and is given cross-component semantic meaning (RSE → AAI binding), **with the constraint that each RSE holds exactly one such attribute.**
3. As (2), but allowing an RSE to hold multiple issuer bindings (e.g. via a JSON-valued attribute or multiple named keys) — considered and rejected for now as solving a problem no current RSE has (see Rejected Alternative below).
4. A new dynamic registry service with its own lookup API, and/or an external secrets manager (e.g. Vault) — considered and rejected as unnecessary scope for the problem at hand (see Rejected Alternative below).

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Multi-entry `idp-secrets.json`, same structure as today, keyed by binding name — plus a new RSE attribute giving that key cross-component meaning, constrained to one binding per RSE — no secrets manager**

This is deliberately **not** a new registry service, and deliberately **not** dependent on an external secrets manager — it is the existing `idp-secrets.json` structure, unchanged, just extended from one issuer entry to a dict of entries keyed by binding name:
```
{
  "egi-dev": {
    "issuer": "https://aai-dev.egi.eu/auth/realms/egi",
    "client_id": "...",
    "client_secret": "...",
    "redirect_uris": [...],
    "audience": "rucio",
    "scope": "openid profile eduperson_entitlement offline_access read:/ write:/",
    "SCIM": { "client_id": "...", "client_secret": "..." }
  },
  "atlas-iam": { "issuer": "...", "...": "..." }
}
```

**Who ingests it**: each component (Rucio, DLM) loads this file itself at startup, exactly as it loads its current single-issuer file today — no new runtime dependency, no service to stand up, no Vault integration. Reload behavior (SIGHUP, interval, or restart) is an implementation detail, not a new architectural piece.

**The RSE-to-IAM binding is established solely through a new, single-valued RSE attribute**: an attribute such as `issuer_binding = egi-dev` is resolved by key lookup into this file. This attribute does not exist in Rucio today as a standard, cross-component concept — this ADR is what gives it that meaning, on top of Rucio's existing generic RSE-attribute mechanism. Each RSE carries **at most one** `issuer_binding` value; an RSE with no such attribute is treated as having no AAI binding configured (behavior for that case — error vs. fallback — is an implementation detail, not part of this decision). Many RSEs sharing the same issuer point to the same entry, so rotating a `client_id`/`client_secret` is one edit to one entry, not a find-and-replace across every RSE.

Because the binding is one-to-one, a flat `rse_attribute` key→string pair is sufficient to represent it — no JSON-valued attribute, multiple named keys, or protocol-definition change is required. This removes what was previously an open point: multi-binding representation is not a gap in the design, it is explicitly excluded from the design's scope.

## Rejected Alternative: Multi-Binding RSE, Dynamic Registry Service, and/or External Secrets Manager

**Multi-binding per RSE** was considered and rejected for now. No current RSE is known to need more than one issuer; DLM's multi-AAI requirement is already satisfied at the level of "different RSEs, different bindings." Building a representation for a cardinality nothing currently needs would add design and implementation cost (JSON-valued attributes or protocol-definition changes) for a hypothetical case. If a genuine single-RSE, multi-issuer requirement appears, it should be handled as a follow-up decision rather than folded into this one.

A live **registry service** and an external **secrets manager** (Vault) were also considered and rejected. They solve real problems (live lookup, secrets never at rest) but add a new deployable component and/or a hard external dependency, without a demonstrated need at the current AAI/component count. Revisit if the number of bindings, secret-rotation frequency, or audit requirements grow enough that keeping `client_secret` inline in a file becomes the actual bottleneck or an unacceptable risk.

## Consequences

### Positive
* No new service, lookup API, or secrets-manager dependency — same ingestion mechanism (load-a-JSON-file-at-startup) components already use today, just keyed by binding name instead of hardcoded to one issuer.
* Adding or rotating an AAI relationship is a single file-entry edit, not a redeploy and not a find-and-replace across every RSE referencing it.
* Multi-AAI components (DLM) are supported without bespoke handling, by binding different RSEs to different issuers.
* The RSE-to-IAM binding is established purely through a generic, single-valued RSE attribute given a new, agreed cross-component meaning — no change to Rucio's attribute mechanism itself, keeping the model simple and consistent with how RSE configuration already works.
* Because cardinality is fixed at one binding per RSE, the representation question that would otherwise be open (JSON-valued attribute vs. multiple keys vs. protocol-definition change) does not need to be answered before implementation.

### Negative
* `client_secret` and SCIM credentials are at rest in the file, same as the current single-issuer config — this decision does not improve secret-at-rest posture, it only removes the single-issuer limitation. File permissions and repo-exclusion remain the only safeguards, not secrets-manager-grade isolation.
* File-based config still needs a reload mechanism (SIGHUP, interval, or restart) for changes to take effect without redeploying the component entirely — worth confirming this already exists rather than assuming it.
* **An RSE that genuinely needs more than one issuer cannot be represented at all under this design** — it is a hard constraint, not a soft limitation. Such a case requires either a follow-up ADR extending the attribute model, or splitting the RSE definition at a different layer (e.g. per-protocol), neither of which is designed here.
* The `issuer_binding` attribute is a new convention this ADR introduces, not an existing Rucio feature — it needs to be documented and adopted consistently by every component reading RSE attributes, or the binding silently fails to resolve.

## Open Points

* Confirm no current or near-term RSE requires more than one issuer binding; this decision depends on that holding true. If it does not hold for a specific RSE, that RSE is out of scope for this mechanism until a follow-up decision extends it.
* Confirm the accepted risk level of `client_secret` at rest in this file is acceptable long-term, or whether it triggers the Rejected Alternative (secrets manager) sooner than assumed.
* **Verify with the Rucio team** whether an experimental or DEP-specific Rucio branch/extension already introduces an RSE→AAI binding attribute, since current public Rucio documentation does not show one — if it exists, this ADR should adopt/align with it rather than defining a competing convention.
* Decide and document the behavior when an RSE has no `issuer_binding` set (hard error at token-acquisition time vs. some fallback) — an implementation detail, but one that should be pinned down before rollout.

## Confirmation

Compliance is confirmed by:
* A defined `issuer_binding` (or equivalent) RSE attribute resolves, by key lookup, into the keyed credential file — this binding is a new cross-component convention, not a pre-existing Rucio feature.
* Each RSE carries at most one `issuer_binding` value; the mechanism does not attempt to support more than one issuer per RSE.
* DLM (or any multi-AAI component) can be configured against N issuers by adding file entries and binding different RSEs to them, without code changes.
* No open question remains about multi-binding representation, because multi-binding is explicitly out of scope for this decision.
