# Multi-Entry AAI Credential File vs Static Single-AAI Config

## Context and Problem Statement

Components that authenticate against an AAI/IAM (Rucio, DLM, and potentially other DEP components) currently assume a single-issuer JSON config containing `client_id`, `client_secret`, scopes, redirect URIs and SCIM credentials for one AAI. This breaks down once a component must integrate against more than one AAI — e.g. DLM needs source and destination tokens from different AAIs, and RSEs may each sit behind a different issuer. The decision concerns how per-issuer client credentials are modeled, stored, and resolved.

This is a credential/config lifecycle concern, distinct from and sitting below the Authorization Service decision (see adr-authorization-service.md).

## Decision Drivers

* Support components acting as multi-AAI clients (e.g. DLM) without one-off config per component.
* Support secret rotation and revocation without redeploying components.
* Let RSE/AAI bindings be discoverable rather than assumed or hardcoded.
* Keep the operational and development footprint small — extend the existing config-loading pattern rather than building new infrastructure, and avoid introducing a secrets-manager dependency this decision does not require.

## Considered Options

1. Static single-AAI JSON config per component (current state).
2. Multi-entry AAI credential file, same structure as today's `idp-secrets.json` (including `client_id`, `client_secret`, `SCIM` credentials inline), keyed by binding name; RSE attribute holds the binding key.
3. A new dynamic registry service with its own lookup API, and/or an external secrets manager (e.g. Vault) — considered and rejected as unnecessary scope for the problem at hand (see Rejected Alternative below).

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Multi-entry `idp-secrets.json`, same structure as today, keyed by binding name — no secrets manager**

This is deliberately **not** a new registry service, and deliberately **not** dependent on an external secrets manager — it is the existing `idp-secrets.json` structure, unchanged, just extended from one issuer entry to a dict of entries keyed by binding name:
```
{
  "egi-dev": {
    "issuer": "https://aai-dev.egi.eu/auth/realms/egi",
    "client_id": "...",
    "client_secret": "...",
    "redirect_uris": [...],
    "audience": "rucio",
    "scope": "openid profile eduperson_entitlement offline_access read:/ write:/",
    "SCIM": { "client_id": "...", "client_secret": "..." }
  },
  "atlas-iam": { "issuer": "...", "...": "..." }
}
```

**Who ingests it**: each component (Rucio, DLM) loads this file itself at startup, exactly as it loads its current single-issuer file today — no new runtime dependency, no service to stand up, no Vault integration. Reload behavior (SIGHUP, interval, or restart) is an implementation detail, not a new architectural piece.

**The RSE-to-IAM binding is established solely through the RSE attribute**: an attribute such as `aai_binding = egi-dev` is resolved by key lookup into this file. Many RSEs sharing the same issuer point to the same entry, so rotating a `client_id`/`client_secret` is one edit to one entry, not a find-and-replace across every RSE.

For Rucio specifically, this relates through RSE attributes (`rse_attribute`), flat key→string pairs — well suited to holding the reference (`aai_binding = egi-dev`), not the entry itself. Sufficient for one RSE with one binding. Not sufficient for an RSE needing more than one binding — flat attributes can't express a list. That case needs one of: multiple named attribute keys (`aai_binding_src`/`aai_binding_dst`, doesn't generalize), a JSON-valued attribute if supported, or the reference moved into RSE protocol definitions instead. Undecided — see Open Points.

## Rejected Alternative: Dynamic Registry Service and/or External Secrets Manager

Both a live registry service and an external secrets manager (Vault) were considered and rejected for now. They solve real problems (live lookup, secrets never at rest) but add a new deployable component and/or a hard external dependency, without a demonstrated need at the current AAI/component count. Revisit if the number of bindings, secret-rotation frequency, or audit requirements grow enough that keeping `client_secret` inline in a file becomes the actual bottleneck or an unacceptable risk.

## Consequences

### Positive
* No new service, lookup API, or secrets-manager dependency — same ingestion mechanism (load-a-JSON-file-at-startup) components already use today, just keyed by binding name instead of hardcoded to one issuer.
* Adding or rotating an AAI relationship is a single file-entry edit, not a redeploy and not a find-and-replace across every RSE referencing it.
* Multi-AAI components (DLM) are supported without bespoke handling.
* The RSE-to-IAM binding is established purely through the RSE attribute, keeping the model simple and consistent with how RSE configuration already works.

### Negative
* `client_secret` and SCIM credentials are at rest in the file, same as the current single-issuer config — this decision does not improve secret-at-rest posture, it only removes the single-issuer limitation. File permissions and repo-exclusion remain the only safeguards, not secrets-manager-grade isolation.
* File-based config still needs a reload mechanism (SIGHUP, interval, or restart) for changes to take effect without redeploying the component entirely — worth confirming this already exists rather than assuming it.
* Flat RSE attributes do not natively express an RSE with multiple AAI bindings — see Open Points.

## Open Points

* **Multi-binding RSE representation is undecided.** Choose between multiple named attribute keys (doesn't generalize), a JSON-valued attribute (if supported), or modeling the binding in RSE protocol definitions instead of attributes. Needed before implementation for any RSE that isn't single-AAI.
* Confirm whether Rucio's attribute store in the target deployment(s) accepts JSON values, which would settle the above without a protocol-definition change.
* Confirm the accepted risk level of `client_secret` at rest in this file is acceptable long-term, or whether it triggers the Rejected Alternative (secrets manager) sooner than assumed.

## Confirmation

Compliance is confirmed by:
* Components resolve AAI bindings by RSE attribute reference into the keyed credential file, rather than a single hardcoded issuer.
* DLM (or any multi-AAI component) can be configured against N issuers by adding file entries, without code changes.
* The multi-binding RSE representation is explicitly decided (not defaulted to single-binding by omission) before this ADR is marked accepted.
